This is the code used for preprocessing and analyzing EEG and motion-capturing data for a project investigating the effect of cue modality (data glasses vs. in-ear headphones) on target processing during varying walking difficulties.

The analysis files are ordered consecutively starting with the capital letters and the order number of the script GSxx_. An assortment of helper functions are used within the analysis scripts, starting with lowercase letters lw_, lb_, gs_, which are also available in this repository.
